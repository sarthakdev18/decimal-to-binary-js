# decimal-to-binary-js
20 days of JavaScript coding streak - day 15


In the above program, the user is prompted to enter a decimal number. The number entered by the user is passed as an argument to the convertToBinary() function.

The while loop is used until the number entered by the user becomes 0.

The binary value is calculated by:

bin = bin + rem * i;
Here, rem is the modulus % value of the number when divided by 2 and i gives the place value of the binary number.
